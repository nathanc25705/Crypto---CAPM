# Crypto-CAPM

In this project, I will attempt to fit the Capital Asset Pricing Model to Bitcoin and Litecoin using data
sources such as Yahoo Finance and FRED. Using visualisations and hypothesis tests, I will explore the 
quality and validity of CAPM applied to cryptocurrencies. I have used Python to produce my results,
plots and summaries and Latex to produce the text and formulas for my analysis
